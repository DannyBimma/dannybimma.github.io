          <p>
            The day my brother called, I already knew we wouldn‚Äôt be able to get
            up on a church‚Äôs pulpit and deliver a eulogy for you, so I‚Äôll have
            to do it in the only way I know how to do anything‚Ä¶ to and through a
            computer.
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="assets/images/dad/dad.jpg"
            alt="My dad"
          />

          <p>
            For as long as I could remember, maybe even from the very start, we
            had a fraught relationship. But I‚Äôm not sure what else could be
            expected from a father who divorced my mother immediately after I
            was born. Whatever the reasons, nobody can exactly say that‚Äôs a
            prime way to start any sort of relations‚Äîparental or otherwise.
          </p>

          <p>
            P.s. dear reader, I‚Äôm someone who often makes use of the Harvard
            Comma. So if you dislike them, fuck you and your AI detection tools
            for having never learned their true power in prose‚Ä¶ please, carry
            on.
          </p>

          <p>
            One thing I definitely inherited from you, Dad, is an astounding
            ability to hold the strongest of opinions on things as trivial as an
            emdash. Mind you, my stubbornness could never match yours. But I do
            love being the kind of person who will continue to use the emdash
            and profusely comment my code while everyone else avoids using them
            in this current timeline. Even though you disagreed with pretty much
            everything I did, it‚Äôs because of you I‚Äôm so comfortable doing my
            own thing. But it‚Äôs also why I‚Äôm such a pushover at times.
          </p>

          <p>
            I spent my entire childhood watching you bend everyone around you to
            your will. If you wanted someone to do anything, they either did it
            immediately or eventually. But I swear, up until the day you lost
            all of your strength, I‚Äôve never seen another human being resist
            your decree. As a child, it did more to traumatise than positively
            impress me; you were the most imposing figure I knew, and absolutely
            nothing scared me more than drawing your ire‚Äîoften reducing me to a
            pool of tears with the thunder of your voice alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the other hand, most ladies would describe me as exceptionally
            soft, but that‚Äôs because I explicitly spent my entire life trying to
            get away from and be the complete opposite of you. None of my
            siblings know this, and they never will unless they read/find this
            URL. And as their eldest brother, I sincerely hope they don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ but,
            saying as how three out of your five children are fairly competent
            programmers, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll find this sooner or later.
          </p>

          <p>
            It wasn‚Äôt fair to any of us, it just wasn‚Äôt fair that your youngest
            son had to call his oldest brother at work to tell me our father
            just died. He wasn‚Äôt ready for that, I wasn‚Äôt ready for that, your
            ex-wife wasn‚Äôt ready for that, not a single fucking soul who knew
            you was ready for that!! But you wanted to go, and I suppose as
            always, you just had to do things your own way.
          </p>

          <p>
            The biggest impression a person has left on the world is probably
            what those they left behind say after you‚Äôre gone. The deepest
            sentiment at your funeral was about how talented you were. If
            something falls under the domain of art, I promise you were hands
            down the absolute best I knew at it. You wouldn‚Äôt believe the amount
            of incredible people I‚Äôve met online these past couple of years.
            Amazing as they are, your artwork would make theirs look like utter
            shite by comparison. And though I never dared tell you this in life,
            I was always a little jealous of your natural and seemingly
            effortless talents‚Äîalways resented the way I thought you wasted
            them‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd yank out baby Kurta Clan eyeballs to be able to write, or
            draw, or paint, or cook, or tailor clothes, or play ANY instrument
            as well as you could with anything you ever touched. The world is a
            slightly more beautiful place simply because you lived.
          </p>

          <p>
            May never be as artistically gifted, but you should be beyond proud.
            It only took a distributed ounce of your innate talents for all of
            your children to inherit incredible minds. Collectively, our biggest
            struggle in life is just deciding what to do, as opposed to ever
            feeling like we‚Äôre incapable of doing anything technical. Maybe all
            of your artistic energy was transmuted into the technical prowess
            all of your children share. Growing up in your house, The Dutch
            House, was the best of times and the worst of times. Some days you
            frustrated me to no end, but most of the time I was just in awe
            watching you create.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now that you‚Äôre gone, I could never bring myself to say I ever hated
            you, even if I did feel that way many times as a child while you
            lived‚Ä¶ I mean, you used verbal and corporal punishment on me just
            for watching Pok√©mon. But you were a hardcore Christian, and from
            your perspective, your firstborn son was flippantly enjoying demonic
            programming on TV.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite spending my entire life running away from you, it absolutely
            breaks my heart to know that you‚Äôre not here anymore. You‚Äôll always
            be the most incredible man I‚Äôve ever known, even if I disliked much
            of what you believed about the world. I know you were only trying to
            be the best father and man you could be to us, the best way you knew
            how. And to be honest, I‚Äôd be doing much better in life if I only
            had a slither of your grit and willpower.
          </p>

          <p>
            Luffy is the most dangerous Yonko on the sea, but Garp is the
            celebrated Hero of the Marines. I know you don‚Äôt have a clue what
            the fuck that even means, but just know it‚Äôs so literally us that
            I‚Äôm crying a waterfall as I type it... it‚Äôs just like you to forbid
            your own children from mourning your death. Who the fuck even does
            that üò≠???!!
          </p>

          <p>
            I love you, Dad ‚ù§Ô∏è<br />
            I may not be religious, but I do believe in the eternity of life. On
            a fundamental level, energy cannot be destroyed, it can only ever
            change form, and you were the biggest ball of it I‚Äôve ever known. So
            since I know you‚Äôre seeing this, thanks for giving me a real-life
            Will of D. And for trying your best to be a great man in your own
            way. All I can do now is promise you I‚Äôll try to do the same‚Ä¶ so
            maybe we were always identical in the end üïäÔ∏è
