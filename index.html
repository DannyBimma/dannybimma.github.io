        <div class="article-content">
          <p>
            I am firmly of the opinion that, thanks to the rise of GPTs and
            LLMs, right now can be considered the second best time in history to
            learn to code‚Äîthe first being the very next day after the dotcom
            bubble burst.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though, unlike back then, the reason isn‚Äôt due to a sudden mass
            realisation of the impact one can have on the world by publishing
            good software. No, today it‚Äôs due to most people opting NOT to learn
            how to code because they are poised to simply ask AI to produce the
            software for them.
          </p>

          <p>
            The LLM/GPT CEOs and hype-men are selling the promise that
            Agentic-AI can eventually produce software unicorns for their users
            from a single well-constructed prompt. Where are all the
            prompt-engineers today? This blunder of foresight into the future
            capabilities and use cases of a new technology is most wonderful for
            people who genuinely have a love for writing code; derive joy from
            doing so competently, and who want the things they build to stand
            the test of time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not unlike the compiler and the HTTP server; AI is nothing more than
            an amazing computer program that will permanently change the way the
            world does certain things, but that‚Äôs genuinely all it is. A big
            reason why so many people exaggerate the impact AI will have on the
            world is due to the human tendency of giving computers agency
            whenever we program them to do things that only we could do
            before‚Äîthe chatbot is our latest example of this digital pareidolia.
          </p>

          <p>
            When the ‚Äúadding machines‚Äù of the olden computing days were first
            revealed to the public, people exclaimed how ‚Äúmachines can now think
            and do things that were once the exclusive domain of man.‚Äù And that
            sentiment was as ridiculous back then as it is today. Calculators
            don‚Äôt think, and neither does AI. The use of terms such as training,
            reasoning, hallucinating, lying, and empathising has done more to
            confuse the public about AI than it has to help them understand it.
            The reason so many non-technical people have no idea they‚Äôre storing
            their personal data on someone else‚Äôs computer is because we call it
            the cloud. There is a non-zero percentage of people out there who
            truly believe their graduation photos of little Bobby Tables are
            safe and sound in the atmosphere.
          </p>

          <p>
            AI seems so much more amazing than a traditional computer program
            that prints ‚ÄúHello, world‚Äù to the console because we can‚Äôt see
            what‚Äôs in the black box. Every single computer program in the world
            takes an input, does something with it, and produces an output. AI
            works in the same exact way; the only difference is that we have no
            idea what it does with the input/tokens/the prompt before handing us
            back its output-token/the response.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just because we can‚Äôt see/understand a thing does not mean it
            carries a mystic power; this has been a very tough pill for humans
            to swallow throughout the course of history. The discovery of fire
            really fucked-up our caveman brains for a few years. But once we
            understood what fuels a fire, learned how to control it, and gained
            the ability to wield it safely; fire became the tool we used to pave
            our future and to more efficiently kill each other. The same can be
            said for the internet, and the same will be true for Artificially
            Intelligent, Generatively Pre-trained Large Language Models.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Vanilla JavaScript?</h2>
          <p>
            Don't get me wrong‚Äîframeworks like React, Vue, and Angular are
            fantastic tools. But sometimes, reaching for a framework is like
            using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Here's why vanilla JavaScript
            deserves a place in your toolkit:
          </p>

          <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem">
            <li>
              <strong>Performance:</strong> No framework overhead means faster
              load times and better runtime performance
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Understanding:</strong> Working with vanilla JS deepens
              your understanding of the language
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Flexibility:</strong> You're not constrained by framework
              conventions or paradigms
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Longevity:</strong> JavaScript will outlive any framework
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Modern JavaScript Features That Change Everything</h2>
          <p>
            Modern JavaScript has evolved significantly. With ES6+ features, the
            language now provides many capabilities that previously required
            frameworks:
          </p>

          <pre><code>// Modern class syntax
class ComponentManager {
  constructor(selector) {
    this.element = document.querySelector(selector);
    this.init();
  }

  async init() {
    const data = await this.fetchData();
    this.render(data);
  }

  async fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data');
    return response.json();
  }

  render(data) {
    this.element.innerHTML = `
      &lt;div class="component"&gt;
        ${data.map(item => `&lt;p&gt;${item.title}&lt;/p&gt;`).join('')}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    `;
  }
}</code></pre>

          <h2>Building This Blog: A Case Study</h2>
          <p>
            This very blog you're reading is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. Here's what I implemented without any frameworks:
          </p>

          <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem">
            <li>Theme switching with localStorage persistence</li>
            <li>Responsive navigation with mobile hamburger menu</li>
            <li>Like system with client-side storage</li>
            <li>Smooth scrolling and fade-in animations</li>
            <li>Form validation and handling</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The entire codebase is lean, maintainable, and performs excellently
            across all devices. Best of all, it will continue to work as long as
            browsers support JavaScript‚Äîno dependency updates required.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            While frameworks have their place, don't underestimate the power of
            vanilla JavaScript. Whether you're building a simple blog, a
            portfolio site, or even complex web applications, sometimes the best
            tool is the one that's already built into every browser.
          </p>
