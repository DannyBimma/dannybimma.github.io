            <h2>Hello, I'm Danny Bimma</h2>
            <p>
              I consider myself to still be quite early in my developer journey
              (less than five years total), but hopefully I remember to update
              this page as I grow. The first lines of code I ever wrote date
              back some 20 freaking years, back when the Sony PSP handheld
              console first hit the market. I was lucky enough as a child to
              have a mother who supported all of my nerd-isms, and so she would
              always go out of her way to get these computer things that excited
              me‚Äîeven when she probably couldn‚Äôt afford it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Which is why upon modding my PSP for the first time, I did it with
              the precision and care of a veteran surgeon on the final
              open-heart operation of his career. The way you had to crack open
              the rechargeable-battery casing in order to gain access to the
              PSP‚Äôs silicon for modding, it certainly felt surgical. But soon
              thereafter that first time, I was running a small illegal business
              hacking the PSPs of students in my secondary school so they could
              play AAA games for free. The entire process involved me doing
              nothing more than erasing traces in the silicon, redrawing them
              with a NO.2 pencil, and copy/pasting questionable code from the
              internet directly into the shell of a mobile gaming PC‚Ä¶ literally
              nothing could‚Äôve gone wrong. Strictly speaking, I had no idea what
              I was doing; and I was genuinely surprised every time I
              successfully hacked a PSP without bricking some poor chaps‚Äô
              console. Nonetheless, I eventually left my life of crime behind
              and never wrote, touched, or thought about code again until The
              Pandemic.
            </p>

            <p>
              Shortly after lockdowns started, I began officially learning to
              code in earnest. For my entire life, I‚Äôve had a love affair with
              computers, but for some reason, it never occurred to me that I
              should probably learn to programme them‚Äînot until the day the
              Earth stood still. After taking several ‚ÄúBecome a Full Stack
              Developer in x Days‚Äù courses on Udemy, I learned enough about web
              dev tech to freelance on sites like Fiverr and UpWork.
              Unfortunately, due to the incredible amount of completely
              disconnected and mundane ‚Äújobs‚Äù I‚Äôd have to do to make a
              consistent income, I suffered some immense burnout rather quickly‚Ä¶
              which led to me running away from the tech industry as a whole for
              about two years.
            </p>

            <p>
              And now (as of Jan-2025) I‚Äôm back, armed with more life experience
              and a bigger appreciation for the love of computers. I figured out
              that the world of software engineering goes many leagues beyond
              JavaScript, and I simply didn‚Äôt enjoy developing for the web. When
              people learn to program outside of the traditional college route,
              it can seem like web development is the be-all and end-all of
              coding. It‚Äôs a truly amazing piece of technology (the web); it
              changed the entire world, the entire course of human history; but
              building on it can be a royal pain in the posterior for some
              people (especially me).
            </p>

            <p>
              I‚Äôve fallen in love with C ever since my return to code, and I‚Äôd
              genuinely love to spend the rest of my life writing the Lord‚Äôs
              Language on a daily basis. I‚Äôm currently going through ‚ÄúThe (ANSI
              C) Programming Language‚Äù white book by Ritchie and Kernighan,
              using it to become as comfortable and competent as I possibly can
              in the language. I have no idea where this road I‚Äôm going down
              will lead. I just know writing parsers, interpreters, network
              code, CLI tools, APIs, and doing systems/backend development in
              general is the kind of engineering I truly enjoy. And although I
              wish I knew this about myself 5 years ago, I guess it‚Äôs never too
              late to experience your first segmentation fault üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è
            </p>

            <h3>What I Can Do</h3>
            <p>
              I currently specialise in building whimsically-named applications
              for fun, but also serve to teach me new things about C:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem">
              <li>
                <strong>Tool Development:</strong> CLI tools, parsers, and
                interpreters
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Backend Development:</strong> Server-side logic, APIs,
                and database design
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>System Programming:</strong> C programming and low-level
                optimisations
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
            <p>
              I believe in writing code that is not only functional but also
              maintainable, readable, efficient, and fun to both read and write.
              Whether it's a simple HTML formatter or something as complex as an
              HTTP server, I strive to create software that will stand the test
              of time.

            <h3>When I'm Not Squashing Bugs</h3>
            <p>
              Besides coding, the only other things I can truly get lost in are
              watching anime and reading manga. My favourite series in the
              entire world is One Piece, and if you are as well please find a
              way to connect with me‚Äîwe have lots to discuss.
            </p>

            <h3>Let's Connect</h3>
            <p>
              I'm always interested in connecting with fellow developers, and
              manic One Piece fans. Whether you have a question about one of my
              projects, Monkey D. Luffy, want to share an idea, or just want to
              say hello to a fellow Nakama, I'd love to hear from you!
