        <div class="article-content">
          <p>
            I am firmly of the opinion that, thanks to the rise of GPTs and
            LLMs, right now can be considered the second best time in history to
            learn to code—the first being the very next day after the dotcom
            bubble burst.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though, unlike back then, the reason isn't due to a sudden mass
            realisation of the impact one can have on the world by publishing
            good software. No, today it's due to most people opting NOT to learn
            how to code because they are poised to simply ask AI to produce the
            software for them.
          </p>

          <p>
            The LLM/GPT CEOs and hype-men are selling the promise that
            Agentic-AI can eventually produce software unicorns for their users
            from a single well-constructed prompt. Where are all the
            prompt-engineers today? This blunder of foresight into the future
            capabilities and use cases of a new technology is most wonderful for
            people who genuinely have a love for writing code; derive joy from
            doing so competently, and who want the things they build to stand
            the test of time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not unlike the compiler and the HTTP server; AI is nothing more than
            an amazing computer program that will permanently change the way the
            world does certain things, but that's genuinely all it is. A big
            reason why so many people exaggerate the impact AI will have on the
            world is due to the human tendency of giving computers agency
            whenever we program them to do things that only we could do
            before—the chatbot is our latest example of this digital pareidolia.
          </p>

          <p>
            When the "adding machines" of the olden computing days were first
            revealed to the public, people exclaimed how "machines can now think
            and do things that were once the exclusive domain of man." And that
            sentiment was as ridiculous back then as it is today. Calculators
            don't think, and neither does AI. The use of terms such as training,
            reasoning, hallucinating, lying, and empathising has done more to
            confuse the public about AI than it has to help them understand it.
            The reason so many non-technical people have no idea they're storing
            their personal data on someone else's computer is because we call it
            the cloud. There is a non-zero percentage of people out there who
            truly believe their graduation photos of little Bobby Tables are
            safe and sound in the atmosphere.
          </p>

          <img

            src="../assets/images/no_cloud_yoda.png"
            alt="Yoda saying 'No Cloud'"
          />

          <p>
            AI seems so much more amazing than a traditional computer program
            that prints "Hello, world" to the console because we can't see
            what's in the black box. Every single computer program in the world
            takes an input, does something with it, and produces an output. AI
            works in the same exact way; the only difference is that we have no
            idea what it does with the input/tokens/the prompt before handing us
            back its output-token/the response.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just because we can't see/understand a thing does not mean it
            carries a mystic power; this has been a very tough pill for humans
            to swallow throughout the course of history. The discovery of fire
            really fucked-up our caveman brains for a few years. But once we
            understood what fuels a fire, learned how to control it, and gained
            the ability to wield it safely; fire became the tool we used to pave
            our future and to more efficiently kill each other. The same can be
            said for the internet, and the same will be true for Artificially
            Intelligent, Generatively Pre-trained Large Language Models.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Vibe-coding Works Best When You Already Know the Vibes of Coding
          </h2>

          <p>
            When I first started learning to code, "prettier tools" and LSPs
            were just beginning their rise to prominence. Old heads would look
            down upon plebeians like me who wrote code by getting assistance
            from their IDE, as if using Emacs or Notepad++ was how one
            identified a good programmer. The field of Computer Science has
            always had a fraught relationship with abstraction; some believe it
            to be the devil while others see it to be god's gift to man and
            there is seemingly no state in-between. But that state is exactly
            where I find myself, much like Luffy that one time in Water 7.
          </p>

          <img

          />

          <p>
            From Grace Hopper's battle for the acceptance of compilers in the CS
            industry to the current crop of AI code generation tools today.
            Every time an era produces a technology that has lowered the barrier
            of entry into tech, the stalwarts of the industry have recoiled
            against it. I too was initially of that anti-AI camp until I started
            using it; saw its imperfections, identified its usefulness, and
            worked it into the vibes of my code.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using AI to build things without actually knowing how to read and
            write proper code is equally as ignorant as hopping into a Cessna
            cockpit and engaging autopilot when you haven't a clue how to fly.
            You CAN do it, but it defeats the entire purpose of the technology
            and the outcome could potentially kill people.
          </p>

          <p>
            Repeatedly tossing an error message back into the context window on
            an Agent will only take you so far, and the convoluted mess that
            results from brute forcing AI to write robust code is downright
            disgusting. Every single time I've asked any AI model to output an
            entire program for me, I've had to go in and make significant
            changes myself. This doesn't bother me too much. Unlike most
            programmers, I happen to actually enjoy reading code, especially if
            that code is C.
          </p>

          <h2>Turning AI into Cocaine AI Using The Lord's Language</h2>
          <p>
            I think leaders in the tech industry should start talking about AI
            the way medical professionals talk about cocaine. That is to say,
            the Anthropic CEO should shut the fuck up a little and just let
            programmers use it at their own discretion to ease the pains of
            binary surgery.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every dental office and operating room in the world is filled with
            enough cocaine (liquid form) to knock out a herd of African Savannah
            Elephants. But you'll never hear a dentist publishing an industry
            memo evangelising the wonders of the white lady; or lamenting the
            impending doom of society due to coked-up patients running amok
            after discharge. Mostly because medical-grade cocaine is a
            controlled substance, but also because they know its power would be
            abused outside of professional practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm currently working through "The C Programming Language" aka
            White-book C by Kernighan and Ritchie. Among the initial exercises
            are a slew of text stream processing tasks. And while scrolling
            through the r/ProgrammerHumor Subreddit with those fresh in my
            brain, one post gave me a sudden inspiration to build the perfect
            find and replace tool for reading the smorgasbord of AI articles
            being pumped out on a daily basis these days. Yes, that includes
            this one 🤦🏾‍♂️
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"

          />

          <p>
            "AI to Cocaine" is a C program that iterates over every character in
            a text stream from stdin, and looks for every occurrence of the
            string "AI" to replace it with "cocaine." Admittedly, initially I
            just thought this would be funny, and to my credit it IS indeed
            hilarious. But as I was building and repeatedly testing it on
            different articles, I came to the realisation that it could serve as
            a practical and sobering tool.
          </p>

          <p>
            The outputs of this program read as ridiculous as any purposefully
            leaked memo put out there in order to aura-farm AI and coax money
            out of investors' pockets. So when reading and considering your
            future within this latest tech bubble, remember the reason why
            Pets.com failed but Amazon is a billion-dollar titan of industry.
            Hint: one company was riding a wave, while the other used the
            emergent technology to make waves of their own.
          </p>

          <h2>The Magic Behind Cocaine</h2>

            As I'm currently on a journey to become the best C developer I could
            be, to then use that knowledge as a base to become the best Swift
            developer I could be, I welcome the inspiration to build fun little
            CLI programs like this. I tried to make the code as memory safe,
            efficient, readable, and maintainable as possible. Obviously, that's
            somewhat easy and meaningless for ~90 lines of ANSI-C, but a wise
            man once said, "the way you do one thing is the way you do
            everything." Which is simply to say if you write shitty code in your
            weekend projects, you're gonna write shitty code and push it to
            production—no matter what day of the week it is.
          </p>

          <p>
            My code begins with some macros to define the heavy lifting
            variables of the program. There's only one function besides main,
            but it's a fairly chunky boi considering the size of the codebase
            it's sitting in. I very well could've just put all this code into
            main to run the program raw, but "ai_cocainizer" is the coolest
            fucking name ever given to a helper function, and I simply could not
            resist.
          </p>

          <p>
            As someone who truly loves for-loops, and believes almost every
            while loop should be converted to such, sometimes it just honestly
            feels unnecessary. The for-loops I would've had to write to mimic
            the whiles here just looked ugly and out of place to me. And the
            logic of the loops themselves is just easier to follow as a
            while-loop.
          </p>

          <pre><code>
            // First pass: - REFACTORED TO FOR LOOP
    for (temp = (char*)input; (pos = strstr(temp, search_term)) != NULL; temp = pos + search_len) {
        count++;  // Count each occurrence found
    }
          </code></pre>

          <h2>And The Money Shot:</h2>
          <pre><code>
            // Second pass: - REFACTORED TO FOR LOOP
            for (int i = 0, j = 0; input[i] != '\0'; ) {
                if (strncmp(&input[i], search_term, search_len) == 0) {
                    // Found a match - copy the replacement string
                    strcpy(&result[j], replace_term);
                    j += replace_len;      // Move output pointer past replacement
                    i += search_len;       // Skip search term in input
                } else {
                    // No match - copy single character
                    result[j] = input[i];
                    i++;
                    j++;
                }
            }
          </code></pre>

          <p>
            Although there is nothing particularly amazing about the code behind
            this silly program that I wrote, I had a lot of fun doing so and it
            inspired me to write this article. As a reminder to me and software
            engineers who care to savour the process of writing code and seeing
            the magic it brings.
          </p>

          <p>
            If your goal is simply to put programs out there that can make quick
            bucks, then by all means do you and vibe code till the inference
            comes home. But if you truly love the science of computers, and
            enjoy making your fingers dance across a keyboard to write glyphs
            that make CPUs do magic; then have fun with this new technology and
            use it to accelerate your learning. And if you really are passionate
            about software/technology, then you'll already know exactly how to
            do that!
          </p>

          <p>Happy coding, and safe vibing ✌🏾🚀</p>
