          <p>
            It all started sometime last week; I had just awoken from my nightly
            slumber, and after staring at the ceiling for a couple of mins to
            give my brain time to boot up my bodily systems and function for the
            day, I rolled over to grab my phone. I opened the Pok√©mon TCGP app
            and BOOM!! There it was, the Mythical Island Booster Pack! With no
            less than my absolute favourite Pok√©mon, Mew, gorgeously gracing the
            cover ü•π
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c771b4c-e8c7-48f3-9e5c-f5f775b35028_2160x1080.heic"
            alt="Mew on the cover of the Mythical Island Booster Pack"
          />

          <p>
            So, I obviously and excitedly ripped open the new pack as soon as I
            could‚Ä¶ and no Mew. I opened about 6 packs in the subsequent days,
            but no Mew. I returned to Threads to find my feed awash with other
            players who were swimming in elation after opening ‚ÄúGods Packs‚Äù
            containing multiple iterations of my beloved Mew. It pissed me off!
            So much so I yeeted all the gold and Pack Hour Glasses I had been
            accumulating for months to force open a 10-pack, and still, NO MEW
            üòî!
          </p>

          <p>
            The 10-pack dud was the last straw! I deduced that such a
            statistical anomaly could only mean one thing: the game devs had
            purposely singled out my account and banned me from acquiring Mew‚Ä¶
            and I was not about to take that laying down. And so, I decided to
            build my own version of the game that simulates opening a Booster
            Pack‚Äîgiving myself Mew every, single, time üò†!
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b2c1480-18b0-4193-b4fe-73387ecfc26a_867x863.heic"

          />

          <h2>The Language</h2>

          <p>
            I actually started building this thing in C, and that‚Äôs only because
            it‚Äôs the language I‚Äôm most comfortable with. So when I start
            picturing things in code, I do so in C. And it was going great to be
            honest, up until I got to the point where I had to build my own
            function to parse the JSON data. And I mean, I was salty, but not
            saltine enough to deal with all that jazz‚ÄîPython was always the only
            option for me üôÑ
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8a6cf86-4f5d-46b2-9682-d286a7cad8ac_2500x2140.heic"
            alt="C memory leak meme"
          />

          <p>
            Python programmers laud the language for its speed of development.
            For me, I find that sentiment to be both true and untrue at the same
            damn time. True in the sense that you can write a ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù
            program faster in Python than you can even think about it in ANY
            other language. And false in that if your program is any bigger than
            4 lines of code, the simplicity of Python‚Äôs syntax gets more and
            more complex with each additional line.
          </p>

          <h3>What in the Indentation is Python All About?</h3>

          <p>
            In my poke_play program, there‚Äôs a method called [load_booster_pck]
            in the [PokedexAPI] class (built to receive & process the API Data)
            which returns a list of 5 random selected Pok√©mon. It is the literal
            crux of the whole application. If it was unable to return that list,
            none of the logic in my main function would work after asking for
            user input. And for hours, I COULD NOT GET IT TO WORK!
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38feecdf-280f-4a68-b4e4-fd7311693860_2032x1210.heic"
            alt="Python code"
          />

          <p>
            No matter how long I stared at my source code; I could not figure
            out why main wasn‚Äôt getting access to a list being returned by a
            method in a class that was clearly instantiated in main‚Äôs very first
            line!! If you‚Äôre a non-technical person, that probably sounds like
            utter gibberish. But take my word for it. As far as I could see, I
            did everything correctly, but my code still wasn‚Äôt running as
            expected‚Ä¶
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feae2d485-5509-4161-967d-bd0b54c0981b_534x523.heic"
            alt="Python code meme"
          />

          <p>
            Of course, the truth was I hadn‚Äôt in fact done everything correctly,
            or at least not in the Pythonian way. The reason main couldn‚Äôt
            access the list even though there was an instance of it on the very
            first line; the reason half the variables I declared in the
            PokedexAPI class seemed scooped to themselves, the reason my code
            wouldn‚Äôt run as expected after 4 straight-hyper-focused hours of
            writing it, was all because of some gosh darn indentation errors.
            It‚Äôs not even funny, it‚Äôs actually ridiculous. The human eye was not
            built for readily identifying indents üò≠!
          </p>

          <p>
            Take this meme below as an example. It‚Äôs meant to be funny because
            the two blocks of code are exactly the same, but the fact that
            Python made me stare at this image for 15 fucking minutes to deduce
            that is objectively insane!! Also, the really funny part about that
            is both blocks of code would fail because the person who made it
            forgot a fucking colon on line 5. Sigh; excuse my French, I shall
            begin to digress üòû
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4468e67f-dac6-4854-b72e-4ab170394410_940x940.heic"
            alt="Python indentation meme"
          />

          <p>
            I mean, as an old web dev, I used to find the JavaScript ‚Äúmissing
            semicolon joke‚Äù to be extremely hilarious. Mostly because JS was
            getting dragged for something it correctly inherited from C. But
            Python‚Äôs indentation syntax is the absolute worst solution to
            anything I‚Äôve ever had the horror of seeing in my life‚Äîespecially
            for something that was never a problem in the first place. Opting
            for indentation over curly braces was a mistake, and I hope Guido
            van Rossum knows that.
          </p>

          <h2>The Main Logic of My Code</h2>

          <p>
            They say the Python Programming language is so close to natural
            language that you don‚Äôt even need a main function. But if you
            actually want to write a program bigger than 10 lines with it and
            also keep your sanity, you will absolutely need a main function!!
            Anyway, as mentioned previously, my main starts with an instance of
            the fabled PokedexAPI. Next, I use Python‚Äôs input function to ask
            the user for their name and strip it of any trailing space.
          </p>

          <p>
            The simple control flow that follows is where all the magic happens.
            If the user name entered is specifically mine, then the
            [load_booster_pck]method will instantaneously return Mew followed by
            4 random cards to make 5. ELSE IF it‚Äôs any other username, the
            method simply returns 5 random cards. An absolute genius, aren‚Äôt I?
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ca6e3c4-ca21-48c7-be7b-23b9eec2a87b_1886x454.heic"
            alt="Python code"
          />

          <h3>Getting All Up in that API</h3>

          <p>
            After about 2 days of reading the PokeAPI doc as much and as often
            as I could, I now feel I know more about Pok√©mon than I ever have
            before. Which does actually feel incredible. I learned things like
            the fact that they‚Äôve issued exactly 898 Pok√©mon IDs to new
            creatures as of Generation 8. And the reason Mewtwo‚Äôs ID is 150
            while Mew‚Äôs is 151, although Mewtwo is Mew‚Äôs clone, is all because
            the original game devs planned for Mewtwo to be obtainable in-game
            as the last all-powerful Pok√©mon, and thus was given number 150. But
            Mew was created very shortly after as a buff that could only be had
            through special events.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, since the source code for the original game had already
            been written and shipped. The devs had no choice but to give Mew
            151. In a nutshell, the devs finished writing their code before the
            storytellers finished writing their lore‚Äîtypical behaviour from both
            fields.
          </p>

            alt="Writer's block meme"
          />

          <p>
            Throughout this return to coding journey of mine, someone dear to me
            commented how they weren‚Äôt surprised by my love for coding once they
            found out that it involves more reading of docs than writing of
            code. And my love of stories is something I never connected to my
            love of code until she pointed it out to me.
          </p>

          <p>
            Which leads me to my personal favourite block of code in the whole
            base. It‚Äôs the [get_pokes] method! A simple function in the API
            class which does a try-catch API call. For as much gripe as I‚Äôve
            given Python in the first half of this article, it has to be said
            was a joy writing this was!! I think too much abstraction in
            programming is just as wrong as too little abstraction, and I also
            believe what is too much or too little is totally down to personal
            preference. And Python having a built-in library specifically for
            handling API calls and parsing JSON data, is exactly the amount of
            abstraction you need to build a CLI game real quick in a fit of
            anger.
          </p>

          <p>
            Oh, and I set the timeout on the response to 69 seconds, because I‚Äôm
            the type of guy to sit and stare at a cursor blinking on a blank
            screen for a minute and 9 seconds just to have a little chuckle once
            that code ran ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ae70ce-6849-433e-b7fd-bf9997dc49a5_2052x1210.heic"
            alt="Python code"
          />

          <h2>That‚Äôs All I Wrote</h2>
          <p>
            That's all folks! The actual game itself is nothing more than a
            terminal application that simulates opening a Pok√©mon TCGP Booster
            Pack in plain text. It‚Äôs fun for about 10 mins and then you‚Äôll get
            tired of it, but the fun I had writing it will stay with me for a
            long time.
          </p>

          <p>
            I guess anyone is welcome to try it out for themselves, it‚Äôs half
            the reason I put it on Github. But honestly, I really wouldn‚Äôt
            recommend doing that unless you‚Äôre a technical person. Running code
            from a random box on the internet directly on your personal machine
            is always a bad idea if you don‚Äôt know what that code does.
          </p>
