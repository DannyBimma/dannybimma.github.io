            Right off the bat, the chapter answered one of the biggest questions
            I had about Loki‚Äîwhat could he have seen in Rocks to idolise him the
            way he did? But it made perfect sense once it was revealed that
            Rocks and his unstoppable, primordial crew were the first humans
            Loki ever met. Matter of fact, the narrator went out of their way to
            ensure the audience knows Rocks was NOT even a pirate, and had
            absolutely NO crew when he invaded Marijoa and broke into Mu's
            private room.

            Xe Bec made it all the way to The Holy Land, and was able to land a
            personal threat to the one currently ruling the world‚Ä¶ BY HIMSELF,
            ON A RANDOM THURSDAY AFTERNOON!!
          </p>

            There are very few things Eiichiro Oda loves illustrating more than
            the price of prejudice. The heavy cost of judging a book before even
            having read it. He's shown us someone who was once painted as one of
            the biggest antagonists in a story, can actually turn out to be one
            of its biggest heroes before the end of it. Or, having one character
            completely underestimate the strength/integrity of another, only to
            be humbled or shocked within an inch of their life when confronting
            the one they wrongly judged. Loki spent his entire life up until he
            met Rocks thinking that no human was worthy of his respect. That if
            full-grown adult giants in his own country weren't strong enough to
            lay a finger on him, what could puny humans hope to do‚Ä¶ then a puny
            human named Rocks randomly appeared one day and beat his ass. I'm
            100% against child abuse, but I AM glad Rocks gave Loki a beating,
            he really needed that.
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="../assets/images/visit_to_loki.jpeg"
            alt="Rocks visiting Loki"
          />

          <p>
            Not only was Xe Bec the first human Loki ever saw in the flesh, but
            he was the first person who ever rivalled him in strength, and the
            first man he ever saw oppose his father's Kingly position. This man
            walked up to the ancient giant and King of Elbaph, The Great Harald,
            and casually asked him to serve. One of the same humans Loki once
            assumed to be puny little weaklings, just kicked down his front
            door, smacked him upside the head, and told his father to come work
            for him... kid Loki had no choice but to be taken aback by this man.
            This was definitely Rocks' chapter from start to finish; and I
            wouldn't be at all upset if it turned into his flashback entirely.
            This man commands something that goes way beyond aura. Roger,
            Shanks, Luffy, even fucking Imu themselves somehow look like chumps
            when held up before Xe Bec.

            alt="Rocks speaking to Imu"
          />

          <p>
            Furthermore, what does Rocks mean when he says he worships Davy
            Jones? And why the fuck would knowing this about Rocks cause Imu to
            take pause?? We've only heard mention of the Davy Jones legend once
            before in One Piece, and that was during the infamous Davy Back
            fight in Long Ring Long Land!! So, Davy Jones was definitely a real
            legendary character who lived in the OP universe. But just how big
            was his legend... big enough to warrant a Mystical Devil Fruit
            ability? As big a legend as Nika??

          <p>
            This may be a silly side-track, but I have a long-running personal
            theory that says: The Darkness Fruit was the SECOND DF Black Beard
            ate; the first was one that allows him to eat other DFs. It's AFO vs
            OFA all over again!! Fuck!! I knew Oda was going to end up making
            that old Long Ring Long Land arc one of the most integral to the
            entire saga!!
          </p>

          <p>
            The end of the chapter even managed to bring the beginning
            full-circle for me; because Rocks was the only man who changed
            Loki's world view, or rather, he was the first person who ever got
            Loki to consider/see the world. Sure, it was in the context of
            dominating the damn planet, but still. Not even King Harald with his
            constant pilgrimages to allies around the globe, was able to show
            Loki the world was much bigger than he could ever imagine. When Loki
            saw Rocks speak, it was the first time he ever internalised the
            world being way bigger than the giant tree he lived on. Salvation!!
            For the first time, the demon child was given a reason to live!! And
            if he does end up joining our crew, that would make him the second
            demon child we have in our ranks. It's safe to say my Captain has a
            type, and it's all the people who are rejected by society ü•π.
