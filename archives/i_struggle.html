            I‚Äôm not even sure why I‚Äôm writing this, like what‚Äôs the point‚Äîthe
            same way I‚Äôm unsure of everything I do. I struggle with confidence
            in knowing what path I‚Äôm supposed to be on. What I‚Äôm meant to be
            doing. I struggle with knowing what‚Äôs worth it.

            Modern-day society has morphed happiness into a fork of many prongs
            in the road. And by the time you hit 30, every passing year adds an
            immense pressure to pick the right one. Lest you find yourself
            unhappy, with limited mobility, and swimming in a pool of pain every
            day‚Äîall before you even reach your elder years.
          </p>

          <p>
            In pursuit of avoiding such a fate, I inadvertently kept my level of
            happiness directly inverse to my level of after-work productivity.
          </p>

            I feel a sad guilt for spending less time shooting the shits with my
            friends online (I don‚Äôt have any to speak of in my locale), for not
            reading as many books and manga as I used to, for not remembering
            the last time I sat and enjoyed a feature-length film.
          </p>

          <p>
            Will coming home every day after work to put in hours of additional
            work meant to improve oneself be worth it? What if the hours, days,
            weeks, months, and years I spend walking this path only reveal it to
            be the wrong one? Is there even a right path? How different is real
            life from a standardised play-through of a Pok√©mon game?
          </p>

          <p>
            I kid but most of my problems feel equatable to Nintendo‚Äôs
            entertainment compared to what I see people going through every day.
            I‚Äôm a game developer who is pissed off because he can‚Äôt defeat the
            final boss that he created!!

          <p>
            The hardships I‚Äôve experienced in my life so far have come from the
            thoughts produced by my own brain. I get upset when a loud noise
            breaks my concentration and I lose my train of thought, like
            genuinely upset!! Meanwhile, there‚Äôs a kid in the Congo missing two
            limbs and half of their face due to political instability and
            government greed far beyond their control‚Äîand they are happy. Giving
            thanks for the life they still have; quite literally singing and
            dancing through it all. Given that, the fuck is wrong with me? Why
            does waking up with a headache render me useless for the remainder
            of the day?
          </p>

          <p>
            Why am I so soft? So weak? Why do so many little, insignificant
            things break me? Maybe I was just born in the wrong time? Maybe I
            was meant to be born in the time of the philosopher‚Äîwhen people were
            actually paid to contemplate their own existence all day long.
            That‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôm good at‚Äîexcellent, even!! For nobody can
            question what the fuck they‚Äôre meant to be doing on this planet
            better than I can.
          </p>

          <h2>Happiness is a Recursive Function</h2>

          <p>
            There are far too many problems in the world for someone as
            sensitive as I to have to process every day. And I‚Äôve realised that
            a huge part of why I love Computer Science so much is because CS in
            and of itself is a problem‚Äîit is very literally the art of
            problem-solving.
          </p>

          <p>
            I can‚Äôt fix any of the things that are wrong with the world, or
            figure out a way to make sure the ones I love never have to suffer.
            But I CAN fix the problems in my code, and eventually figure out a
            way to sync every time zone in the world up to a single web API; all
            so the otaku friends I met online can have a way to easily see at a
            glance when their favourite seasonal anime are on in their region.
          </p>

          <p>
            Happiness is a very unique and powerful emotion; in programming
            terms, it‚Äôs a lot like a recursive function. It‚Äôs one that can be
            called serendipitously and unexpectedly, but happiness also has the
            ability to call itself. By itself. For itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you‚Äôre walking the street and the rain starts pouring. You may
            be inclined to feel upset about having to walk home in soaked
            clothes. Or you can decide to be happy at the prospect of jumping
            into every puddle you see like a kid all the way home. You don‚Äôt
            even really have to do it if you‚Äôre wearing fancy shoes or
            something. The mere thought of knowing that you could if you wanted
            to should be enough to put a Thanos-sized smile on your face.
          </p>

          <p>
            I suspect most CS students feel the same way I do about finding
            happiness in their work. Matter of fact, it is a fact that there are
            more autistic persons in STEM than in any other field‚Äîit‚Äôs all ripe
            for people who can‚Äôt get out of their own heads. Who knew ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?
          </p>

          <p>
            Having problems is something that‚Äôs considered to directly affect
            your mood; the more problems you have, the more miserable and less
            happy you will be. Except, people who write code for a living choose
            to find joy in giving themselves problems to solve.
          </p>

            The final paragraph of the prologue to the technical epic, ‚ÄúThe Soul
            of a New Machine‚Äù by Tracy Kidder, is probably the single block of
            text most responsible for me wanting to become a software
            developer‚Äîgiving me a lifelong aspiration to one day build a
            computer from scratch.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Pointing the waves of my overactive brain at the all injustices in
            society always leads to immense depression. So instead of being sad
            that I can‚Äôt right the wrongs of this world, I‚Äôll choose to be happy
            that I find personal fulfillment in making things for my friends and
            solving the problems that pop up in my code as I‚Äôm doing so. I‚Äôm
            overjoyed at the thought of one day building something that we can
            all enjoy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of lamenting the fact that I don‚Äôt have the power to create
            a better world, I‚Äôm choosing to be happy that I can use my words to
            tell beautiful stories‚Äîwhether fictional or otherwise.
          </p>

          <p>
            I‚Äôll make the choice to be as happy as I can this year by finding
            joy in rediscovering my love for Computer Science. For me, this will
            mean keeping strict plans to a minimum and simply building and
            learning whatever my heart desires. Without wondering if I should or
            what will happen when I do things.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whatever it is you want to do, the same applies to you. I think the
            goal of life isn‚Äôt to find happiness, it‚Äôs simply to decide what it
            is you‚Äôre going to be happy about ‚úåüèæüíô
