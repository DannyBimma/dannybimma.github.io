          <p>
            About a week ago, I picked up the Tongari Boushi no Atelier
            („Å®„Çì„Åå„ÇäÂ∏ΩÂ≠ê„ÅÆ„Ç¢„Éà„É™„Ç®) manga series. And right off the bat, more
            than a few aspects greatly impressed me about this serialisation.
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="../assets/images/witch-hat/witch-hat-cover.jpg"
            alt="Witch Hat Atelier manga cover"
          />

          <p>
            The stupendously stupefying and intricately detailed illustrations;
            the masterful manipulation of the panels on the page, the deft
            placement and potent usage of negative space, and an extremely
            compelling fantasy epic to weave it all through. These are all the
            elements that made me fall in love with Witch Hat Atelier within its
            initial few pages.
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="../assets/images/witch-hat/panel-manipulation.jpeg"
            alt="Panel manipulation in Witch Hat Atelier"
          />

          <p>
            But what impressed me most of all is the beautifully uncanny way its
            power system fits the world of Computer Science.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most ostensible place this similarity is depicted is in the
            detailed inner workings of the power system itself.
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="../assets/images/witch-hat/magic-explanation.WEBP"
            alt="Magic system explanation"
          />

          <p>
            Runes can be interpreted as main, the entry point to a program, the
            code that roughly defines what an app shall do when it's run.
          </p>

          <p>
            Keystones would be the variables a program uses during its
            execution. The data within them can obviously vary in type, amount,
            length, and shape. These manipulations in the variables then go on
            to dictate exactly how a process will behave.
          </p>

          <p>
            Glyphs are the classic closing of a circuit. The compilation of a
            program, or ./a.out for the highly initiated. That magical moment
            when you get to see the effects of the magic you drew/code you
            wrote.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Witch Hat Atelier series is a gorgeous encapsulation of a truth
            software engineers around the world know deep in their hearts: the
            science of computers is pure magic, and some of it's forbidden!
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="../assets/images/witch-hat/tech-magic-lord.jpeg"
            alt="Tech magic lord"
          />

          <p>
            The way Witch Hat mirrors the world of tech not only resides in
            their magic systems. Frankly, I almost want to believe the mangaka
            wrote code for FAANG in a previous life the way they've so expertly
            shown the clandestine and politically influenced side of the
            industry.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>SPOILER TERRITORY</strong><br />
            One of the first major ah-ha moments in the plot is the revelation
            that anyone‚Äîwith the right tools‚Äîcan draw magic! And that magicians
            are less special beings blessed by the gods and fruits of
            meritocracy, and more lucky bastards who are the poster children of
            unfettered nepotism. Unfortunately, all the same can be said,
            verbatim, for the tech industry in our world.
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="../assets/images/witch-hat/witch-hat-dude.jpeg"
            alt="Character from Witch Hat Atelier"
          />

          <p>
            If a Luffy-obsessed idiot from Barbados can learn to code, and I'm
            pretty sure I'm more skilled than the Zuckerburger himself. Then
            obviously the Tech Lords that rule over us with their magic are not
            deities, and literally any fool can learn to code‚Äîif only they so
            desire.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you don't know how to code, you are not a fool; you are mostly
            likely a very intelligent person who enjoys going outside, touching
            grass, and having hot, steamy sex in the back of old cars like Rose
            and Jack. By comparison, CS is boring, coarse, and it gets
            absolutely everywhere. You'd have to be insane to learn, and
            something far worse to find joy in the Dark Art of writing code...
            what am I even talking about anymore?!
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
            The point is, I love writing/reading code equally as much as I enjoy
            writing/reading prose. I love the things I learn from both
            disciplines and the way I feel creating within them. Matter of fact,
            I wrote this entire essay in NeoVim via Ghostty powered by my
            riced-out config files on both ends!!
          </p>

          <p>
            Tongari Boushi no Atelier has been a beautiful reminder of why I do
            both; of the power and beauty of both computer code and human prose.
            It's a seinen ÈùíÂπ¥ ode to the creatives; if you consider yourself as
            such, you should give it a read. I'm sure it'll at least inspire you
            to write, and hopefully you'll even love it as much as I do üòÅ‚úåüèæ
