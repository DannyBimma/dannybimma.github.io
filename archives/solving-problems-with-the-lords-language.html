            In the initial lectures for this course, the professor, David Malan,
            warns students that taking CS50 is like "drinking from the firehouse
            of education."
          </p>

          <p>
            He wasn't fucking lying. I tried to keep this article as
            non-technical as possible, but it really wasn't that possible. My
            ability to put technical things into everyday terms has been tapped
            to the limit. So if computer code and the intricacies of it are
            boring to you, why are you here?? Seriously, let me know in the
            comments or something üò≥
          </p>

          <h2>6 Problems, 1 Problem Set</h2>

          <p>
            Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but I may or may not be cheating my
            way through this course as I take it a second time ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't have the time to actually read the course's academic policy
            (sorry to the faculty üòî). I just do the obvious to keep myself
            honest; like NOT asking Chat Jippity to solve the problems for me.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's never been ostensibly stated where they stand in looking at
            your own work if you took the course previously. And for some
            reason, Harvard does not give you a new Docker container on their
            GitHub servers if you decide to take the course again, so all my
            previous work is still in there‚Ä¶ why would I, nay, how could
            possibly not look üòÇ??
          </p>

          <p>
            It gets even worse, they usually change up Problem Sets ever so
            slightly each year. But most are mostly the same and some seemingly
            never change a single parameter. The latter was the case for the
            infamous mario.c, the easy version. Before we get to that, however,
            I had to run through the truly easy problems first. The kind that
            literally ask you to do something that was shown on screen during
            the lecture. Meant to be less of a challenge, and more of a primer
            for anyone who's writing code for the first time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since I have more than enough programming experience to be
            comfortable writing basic "hello, world" code, I decided to have a
            little fun with this introductory problem. Like, although it's
            strictly impossible to write a one-liner in C you can get pretty
            damn close if you try hard enough. This is mostly due to the
            preprocessor directives, and the "main" entry point to any C-program
            needing to be at least two lines long. Still, C's boilerplate code
            is sparse compared to something like Java, which means with enough
            effort I can achieve a beautiful abomination like this.
          </p>

          />

          <p>
            Any good programmer knows code like the above should never make it
            into production. Imagine a 50,000-line codebase with 500 different
            functions being called from directly within "printf." And this is
            exactly why LLMs will never fully replace human programmers‚Äîbecause
            most of the code LLMs are scraping from GitHub is bullshit written
            by programmers like me just for shits and giggles. The code is
            technically correct; after all, it passed Harvard's correction-bot
            tests. But it is horribly designed and will become impossible to
            maintain if the codebase were to ever grow. Unfortunately, I don't
            think LLMs will ever be able to square the difference.
          </p>

          <h2>It's a Me, Mario, More or Less</h2>

          <p>
            The object of the "mario" PS in CS50 is to have students write a
            looping program that dynamically prints blocks from the original
            Nintendo game using ASCII art. Or as one Reddit user put it, brain
            numbing hell üòÇ
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="../assets/images/c-programming/c_pro_1.jpg"
            alt="Mario ASCII art example"
          />

          <p>
            It's meant to be one slanted-block (a triangle, I guess), the size
            (height) of which is determined by user input, is the "less
            comfortable" part. After that, the optional harder challenge is to
            programmatically create two opposing towers that are slanted on
            opposite ends, the size of which is also determined by user input.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gauging my growth in thinking algorithmically and understanding the
            core concepts of CS was one of my biggest motivations for retaking
            this course; ya know, instead of taking a new-to-me CS course that
            my brain would've probably been more eager to engage with (new shiny
            things make my ADHD brain go wow).
          </p>

          <p>
            Going back has been sooo fucking worth it!! As I scrolled through my
            old code, literally the very first jottings of C-code I ever wrote,
            I could feel my neurons getting excited from the power of
            spaced-repetition.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the two years in between 2021 and 2024, I refused to write a
            single line of code. Now look at me, roasting my own code and
            deleting entire files in anger just to rewrite them properly from
            scratch. My programming powers and inclinations are back, I AM STILL
            WORTHY üò≠‚úäüèæ !!
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, I wish I had screenshot my previous solution to share the
            source code with the world. It was the most convoluted,
            spaghetti-coded, repetitive, function-less, pile of shit I've ever
            seen!! I literally could not believe I was the idiot who wrote it.
          </p>

          <img

            src="../assets/images/c-programming/c_pro_2.jpg"
            alt="Screenshot of old messy code"
          />

          <p>
            I immediately recoiled in my seat and almost knocked over my coffee
            as soon as I opened the IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
            There was no chance for a screenshot because I fixed the damn thing
            on reflex.
          </p>

          <p>The fixed code:</p>

          <p>Terminal output:</p>

            src="../assets/images/c-programming/c_pro_4.jpg"
            alt="Terminal output showing Mario blocks"
          />

          <p>
            It honestly felt great to see how far I'd come as a writer of
            computer code; hitherto, I never once looked back at my coursework
            since I took CS50 the first time, and that was over 4 years ago.
          </p>

          <p>
            T'was a lovely reminder that taking a mental note of your growth is
            essential to us being motivated to grow some more.
          </p>

          <h2>Now, onto the Hard Part</h2>

          <p>
            As I may or may not have mentioned in my previous post. On my first
            go-around of this course, I completely dodged all the harder Problem
            Sets whenever that option was given.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was never required to do both the hard and the easy problems, and
            at the time, I really just wanted to get through it. This time, I
            still just want to get through it fairly briskly, but I also want to
            do so with some style and finesse üíÖüèæ
          </p>

          <p>
            The more difficult implementation of Mario in CS50, creatively
            called "mario-more," was the only problem in PS-1 that I actually
            had to ponder deeply on to solve. As I mentioned above, I'd never
            done the harder version to any of the PSs, so this was genuinely my
            first time tackling it.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be completely honest, I'm not entirely proud of this one. I know
            it could be significantly better designed, but evidently, I still
            don't have the skills to make it so. My main issue with the way I
            wrote this is the lack of abstraction.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's a main function filled with 1 do-while-loop for input
            validation, and 2 inner for-loops on the same execution level being
            controlled by one big outer for-loop that itself controls how the
            rows of blocks will be printed. Confusing? Exactly!!
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="../assets/images/c-programming/c_pro_5.jpg"
            alt="Complex Mario-more code implementation"
          />

          <p>
            I am the one who wrote this, and without the comments I placed, it'd
            be impossible for even me to know wtf this program does from reading
            the source code. That is inherently bad design. Unfortunately,
            creating art and making things look pretty is not an aspect of
            programming that I enjoy‚ÄîI actually hate that part.
          </p>

          <p>
            So although I could've spent 3-4 days pouring over every line I
            wrote in order to rewrite it better, I didn't. Three aptly named
            functions abstracting the for-loops would clearly spell out to
            anyone reading this code what main is meant to be doing, but I just
            sometimes you gotta accept "good enough" due to skill issues üòî
          </p>

          <p>
            It's next to impossible to get excited and all into things that
            don't tickle my fancy. I loved writing this code, but what it does
            is not something that I'd ever write for myself in real life. And if
            a future employer ever asked me to do it, I'd tell them to please
            ask somebody else.
          </p>

          <p>
            What thrills me most in terms of writing code is writing business
            logic, the back-end, the server-side scripts that send data to
            clients, tapping that binary ass‚Äîit's the very thing I got to do for
            the subsequent problems in this PS-1. Oh joy of joys üò≠‚úäüèæ!!
          </p>

          <h2>Getting Cash with a Greedy Algorithm</h2>

          <p>
            The latter two problems for CS50's PS-1 required students to solve
            money problems using two completely different algorithms. These are
            exactly the type of logic that gets me aroused to write in code üòú
          </p>

          <h3>Cash Money Rec</h3>

          <p>
            The former of the latter, "cash," was the easier of the two and thus
            the one I had done before. It's a simple implementation of a Greedy
            Algorithm that outputs the minimum amount of coins needed for a
            customer's change after a purchase.
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="../assets/images/c-programming/c_pro_6.jpg"
            alt="Cash change algorithm visualization"
          />

          <p>
            Example: if you bought something for 25c but paid with a dollar, a
            Greedy Algo would tell the cashier to give you back exactly 3 coins,
            3 quarters to make the 75c you are owed. Without it, the cashier may
            be tempted to give you 8 coins of change instead, 10 dimes and a
            dirty nickel.
          </p>

          <p>
            I mean, I already had the solution to this one since I did it
            before. But, I did have quite a bit of fun refactoring my old code.
            And remembering how it took me a week or two to figure it out the
            first time. Contrasting that with the way the most optimal solution
            just popped into my head as soon as I read the problem; provided the
            confidence I needed to dive head first into the more difficult
            problem üòå
          </p>

          <h3>For Credit or Debit</h3>

          <p>
            Luhn's Algorithm, also commonly referred to as"mod-10" in the tech
            industry, is a relatively simple checksum that softly validates the
            legitimacy of a credit card number.
          </p>

          <p>
            I just got to say, out of all the problems presented in this PS, I
            definitely had the most fun finding a solution to this one. For me,
            that's where most of the joy in DS&A comes from ü•π
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="../assets/images/c-programming/c_pro_7.jpg"
            alt="Credit card validation algorithm diagram"
          />

          <p>
            Knowing there are 100 different ways to solve a problem, and my job
            is not only to discover and run through them. But also to ultimately
            pick the best one to do the job. All the different possibilities and
            trade-offs and pros and cons of different implementations is
            scintillatingly thrilling‚Ä¶ isn't it?? I mean, I'll never understand
            why the kids in primary school used to call me Mandork üôÑ
          </p>

          <h2>My Sexy Solution</h2>

          <p>
            Allow me to walk you through this source code, for it's the one I'm
            most proud of thus far üòå
          </p>

          <p>
            As you could see, my main function is pretty damn elegant, if I do
            say so myself. The two function prototypes at the top‚Äîluhns_algo and
            card_checker‚Äîare all I need to make this baby run; just wait till
            you see their definitions.
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="../assets/images/c-programming/c_pro_8.jpg"
            alt="Main function with elegant design"
          />

          <p>
            In the main, I start off by getting the user input via the get_long
            function so courteously provided by the CS50 team. Sidetrack on
            that. I've always wondered if and to what extent the CS50 library
            for C has been used in real-life production. Like, a part of me
            without a doubt believes that there's a smart toaster out there
            running code written by "the CS50 Teaching Fellow."
          </p>

          <p>
            The validation step is a simple conditional that checks if there's
            any value being returned from the luhns_algo function. If not, it's
            obviously invalid; stay tuned to see why!! After that, the result of
            the card_checker function‚Ä¶ which, unsurprisingly, checks card
            numbers, is thrown into a variable called card_type. Finally, on the
            very next line, that variable is then thrown into printf() with a
            string format specifier.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, if any seasoned devs happen to be reading this, I want you to
            know it took everything in me not to throw the result of
            card_checker directly into printf() as the second argument. I guess
            it's debatable whether or not it's bad design, but seeing that kind
            of thing never feels clean to me. And I only ever do it for shits
            and giggles to attempt one-liners‚Ä¶ which I actually do earlier in
            this course üòÇ

            My implementation of Luhn's Algorithm starts off by declaring an
            integer variable called "sum" and setting a boolean false-flag (a
            switch, off by default). It also takes a long as input and returns a
            boolean, and I probably should have led with that, but I don't feel
            like restructuring this paragraph right now. Would you believe
            people actually tell me I'm good at writing ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

            Now the next little bit, although I'm very proud of it, I'm again
            unsure if I'm breaking CS50's academic policy. I mean, I genuinely
            don't think so, if only because the point of a course from Harvard
            is to push students beyond their limits‚ÄîPLUS ULTRA!!
          </p>

          <p>
            What I did was use an array alongside one of my favourite functions
            from the C standard library (stdio.h). It somehow felt dishonest to
            use a function that was never once brought up in the course, for a
            technique that was never once hinted at. But as I thought about this
            some more, I realised that that's exactly what the faculty at
            Harvard would expect. And it hit me that that's why I struggled as
            much as I did the first time I took this course.
          </p>

          <p>
            It took a while for me to get comfortable exploring things I was
            never explicitly taught how to do as a programmer. Like I was pretty
            much a tutorial and dev article groupie for months after initially
            completing CS50 years ago. But breaking things is part of being a
            developer, and judging by how willing tech executives are to bring
            AI into their billion-dollar codebases, I'd say that occasionally
            fucking shit up is an encouraged part of the learning process these
            days ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
          </p>

          <p>
            Wait, that was another sidetrack, wasn't it?? Got dammit, ADHD!!
          </p>

          <p>
            Right, so the function I used was sprintf(), which has a dope-ass
            name and the abilities to match. It basically prints shit to a
            buffer instead of to the terminal like printf(). The first argument
            is the array being printed into, the second is the data type being
            printed, and the last is where that data is coming from. In this
            particular case, the data for the last arg is coming from the long
            input my mod-10 function itself. Then, the length of the newly
            converted string of numbers is stored in an aptly named variable.
          </p>

          <p>
            After all the initialising and converting of parameters is done. The
            inverted for-loop that follows is the real crux of this Luhn's
            Algorithm. It's inverted in that it decrements each iteration
            instead of incrementing, so it starts from the back like couples who
            just love doing anal. The first thing it does back there is a little
            trick to convert each char of the string I just converted from a
            long into an integer. Is that stupid? Yes, but it is simultaneously
            brilliant, pay attention and follow along!!
          </p>

          <p>
            The conversion is done by simply casting the char at position "i"
            (the current iteration of the loop) in the string to its numeric
            value by subtracting the ASCII value of '0'. For example, if
            number[i] is "5", its ASCII value is 53, and since "0" has an ASCII
            value of 48, we'll get the number at that position because 53 - 48 =
            5. See?? Fucking brilliant üò≠!!
          </p>

          <img
            class="article-image"
            src="../assets/images/c-programming/c_pro_11.jpg"
            alt="ASCII conversion technique demonstration"
          />

          <p>
            Next up is just the false flag. Since it's set to false by default,
            it will always start with the second digit from the end and double
            its value on the next line as dictated by Luhn. Then, "sum += (digit
            % 10) + (digit / 10)" subsequently adds the two digits of
            double-digit results separately. If the product is NOT a
            double-digit number, its value is simply added to digit with its
            innocence still intact.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once we break out of the inner loop, the outer loop runs again until
            the end of the string, or long, or whatever is now. Then, the false
            flag is flipped to be a truthy value so the loops continue to skip
            every other number.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, after all the digits have been processed, we check to see
            if the sum is divisible by 10. If it is, we return true and if not
            we return false. And bada-boom-bada-bing, that's my interpretation
            of Luhn's Algorithm done and dusted üòÆ‚Äçüí®

          <h2>The Card Checker</h2>

          <p>
            This is the function that's ultimately responsible for determining
            if a number matches the criteria for a Master Card, a Visa Card, or
            if it's an invalid credit card number. The implementation is pretty
            straightforward. It's not what I really had to think about since all
            the determinisms were clearly defined when this problem was
            initially introduced.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't even think I would've felt safe to Google this information
            that the course provided, or even ask AI. Because I'm guessing that
            100 back-to-back searches on the specifics of credit card numbers
            and how to manipulate them would immediately land me on an INTERPOL
            watchlist that I DO NOT want to be on. So thanks for looking out,
            CS50, I'm Black btw üëçüèæ
          </p>

          <p>
            Right, so this function is basically a trio of conditional
            statements that print the type of card number being provided (AMEX
            or VISA or MASTER). And if it's not either of those three it's
            considered invalid. At least for this particular example problem‚Ä¶ I
            doubt this is the code ATM machines run in real life. There ARE
            other credit cards that exist in the world, right üòÇ??

            I still may not enjoy doing stuff like "mario.c," as much as I love
            playing video games. I've never aspired to make my own. So I think
            it's alright if I'll never be able to use C to draw shadows
            recursively on the backs of sprites to make that appear 3D the way
            John Carmack did with Doom. I may never be a Carmack or a Romero,
            but thankfully I don't need that much skill for where I see myself
            as a programmer in 10 years.

            Knowing exactly the type of developer you want to be is a huge
            benefit to knowing what to learn. That's another major mistake I
            made when I was first learning to code. I never really thought about
            or defined what aspects of software development I'd enjoy the most.
            And as a result, I just ended up falling into web development as a
            means to make money, and it burnt me tf out!!
